**SPRINT 3 TASK 1 - Design Patterns 1**

## Summary

This exercise focuses on implementing and understanding design patterns in Java. It involves creating a program that utilizes the Singleton, Abstract Factory, and Command patterns. The application demonstrates the use of these patterns in practical scenarios such as an undo command system, international address and phone number management, and a vehicle action system.

## Technologies

* Java
* Git
* GitHub

## How to run it

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    * Clone the repository to your local machine using Git.
2.  **Run the application:**
    * Execute the `Main` class to run the program.
4.  **Interact with the program:**

    * **Singleton (Undo Command):**
        * The program will allow you to enter commands via the console.
        * Use the "undo" command to remove the last entered command.
        * Use the "history" command to list the current commands.
        * Use the "exit" command to close the program.
    * **Abstract Factory (International Contacts):**
        * The Main class will create and display international contact information, showing the different formats of addresses and phone numbers created by the abstract factory.
    * **Command (Vehicle Actions):**
        * The Main class will create vehicle objects, and execute commands to start, accelerate and brake those vehicles, showing the command pattern in use.
